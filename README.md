# Scheduler For The Pathology Department 
## Using Z3, written in Python
This is the code created for my master thesis where I am trying to create a solver for their workflow. 
Hopefully improving their workflow overall. 

The plan is to create the base case and gradually add more constraints to reach the end product!
One thing that is missing for the base case to be finished is to match each tagged sample with a doctor with the same tag.
