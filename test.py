'''
Base case for handing out the given samples each day at the pathology department. 
Distribute the samples/sections to the different doctors so that it is evenly distributed and 
no one has more than 24 points each day. 

No special cases for the base case. This is only for one day.

-----Questions-----
* Should I have Id for the different samples?
